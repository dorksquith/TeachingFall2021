 \begin{frame}{Recap : LMT dimensions}
To get a grip and do useful science, we should think about what it is important.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Length [L]\\
\item Mass [M]\\
\item Time [T]\
\end{itemize}

The dimension of area is $L^2$. \\[1ex]
\begin{itemize}
\item[a] What is the dimension of volume?\\[1ex]
\item[b] What is the dimension of density (mass/volume)?\\[1ex]
\item[c] What is the dimension of acceleration?\\[1ex]
\item[d] What is the dimension of force?\\[1ex]
\item[e] What is the dimension of energy?\\[1ex]
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The speed of light in a vacuum}

A lot of smart people in history thought that the light did not travel, or travelled at an infinite speed.\\[2ex]

How would you go about trying to measure the speed of light?\\[5ex]

Einstein proved that $c$ is constant in 1905 with his theory of Special Relativity.\\[2ex]

As measurements of $c$ became more sophisticated, the uncertainty on the definition of the metre became a problem\\[1ex]


1983: $c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8$ metres per second (exact).\\

\subsection{Tips \& Tricks}

 \begin{frame}{Precision}
1. Number of significant figures:
%a) 4.0906060 : this has 8 significant figures (8SF)
%b) 0.0906060 : this has 6SF
%c) 400.0906060 : this has 10 SF
%
%Q1) Why does b have 6SF, and not 8?
%A1) The first two figures, 0.0, are not significant because we do not need them to completely describe the number. Easier to see in scientific notation:
%0.0906060 => 9.06060 x 10^{-2} : 6SF
%No additional information is stored in the preceding zeros, therefore they are not significant.
%
%Q2) Why is the trailing zero significant?
%A2) Well, zero is a number. Think about the differences between these:
%4.0906060 : is the result of rounding up any values between 4.09060595 and 4.09060604
%4.090606 : is the result of rounding up any values between 4.0906055 and 4.0906064
%More information is stored in the number with a trailing zero, therefore it is significant.
%
%2. DURING a calculation, it is best not to round up at all. Obviously your calculator will, but most of the problems you will encounter are designed to expect this. Avoid using pen and paper. Using python (or matlab) is recommended - you will receive instruction on this.
%
%3. FOR THE FINAL ANSWER, give an appropriate number of significant figures:
%- Example 1: addition/subtraction
%138.7192 - 4.601 = 134.1182 (calculator)
%                             = 134.118 (final answer, underlined)
%
%So, we don't use more "Right SF"  in the answer than in any part of the question
%
%- Example 2: multiplication/division
%3.214*4.74 = 15.23436 (calculator)
%                  =  15.2 (final answer, underlined)
%
%So, we don't use more "Total SF" in the answer than in any part of the question
