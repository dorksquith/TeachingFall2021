\subsection{Fundamental Constants \& Natural Units}
\begin{frame}{What is a fundamental constant?}

Things that change depending on where and when you measure them:\\[10ex]

Things that do not change depending on where and when you measure them:\\[10ex]


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The speed of light in a vacuum}

A lot of smart people in history thought that the light did not travel, or travelled at an infinite speed.\\[2ex]

How would you go about trying to measure the speed of light?\\[5ex]

Einstein proved that $c$ is constant in 1905 with his theory of Special Relativity.\\[2ex]

As measurements of $c$ became more sophisticated, the uncertainty on the definition of the metre became a problem\\[1ex]

%1983: $c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8$ metres per second (exact).\\

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The Atomic Clock}

In the 20th century, we started to realised that there were some things that were in fact more regular than clockwork, and more stable than lumps of metal\\[1ex]

The atom is like a mechanical clock!\\[16ex]


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Redefining the second  (1967)}
\small

The frequency of light emitted when a Caesium 133 atom undergoes a transition (a hyperfine ground state transition) was constant, enormous, and precisely measurable.\\[1ex]

The light associated with this transition had a measured frequency of 9.19263177 GHz:\\[6ex]

%\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
\begin{center}
1s $ = \displaystyle  \frac{9.192631770 \times 10^{9}}{\Delta \nu_{Cs}} $\\[3ex]
 \end{center}
% \end{minipage}}

 \vspace{0.5cm}
 

Or equivalently:\\[1ex]

 $\Delta \nu_{Cs} = 9.192631770 \times 10^{9}$ Hz = $9.192631770 \times 10^{9}$ s$^{-1}$\\[1ex]
%1983: The metre is redefined as the distance travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second.\\[1ex]

%Fundamental: measurements of $c$ are no longer meaningful. We have fixed its value to exactly that of the world best measurement, and redefined the units accordingly.\\[1ex]
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Redefining the metre (1983)}
\small

The speed of light in a vacuum must be constant according to special relativity. Using this, and the exact definition of a second, we can redefine the metre:\\[1ex]

%\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.75\textwidth}
\begin{center}
1m $ = \displaystyle \left( \frac{9.192631770 \times 10^{9}}{\Delta \nu_{Cs}}\right)  \left( \frac{c}{2.99792458 \times 10^{8}}\right)  $\\[2ex]
 \end{center}
% \end{minipage}}
 \vspace{0.5cm}
 
Or equivalently, $c = 2.99792458 \times 10^{8}$ ms$^{-1}$\\[1ex]


Fundamental: measurements of $c$ are no longer meaningful. We have fixed its value to exactly that of the world best measurement, and redefined the units accordingly.\\[1ex]

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Redefining the kilogram (2019)}
\small
Planck's constant $h$ can be measured in all sorts of ways (as we shall see later), and is known very precisely from these measurements.\\[1ex]

We now use the fixed value of $h = 6.62607015\times10^{-34}$ (units?) to define the kilogram:\\[1ex]

%\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
\begin{center}

1kg $ = \displaystyle  \left( \frac{9.192631770 \times 10^{9}}{\Delta \nu_{Cs}} \right)       \left( \frac{c}{2.99792458 \times 10^{8}}\right)        \left( \frac{h}{6.62607015\times10^{-34}}\right) $\\[2ex]
 \end{center}
% \end{minipage}}
 \vspace{0.5cm}

Note that we are \textbf{not} claiming to know the exact value of $h$ with no uncertainty, even though it kind of feels like we are.\\[1ex]

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Redefining the Ampere (and Coulomb)}
\small
The SI base unit Ampere is the unit of current, and the Coulomb is the unit of charge: 1  A = 1 Coulomb per  second\\[1ex]

We can measure the charge on an electron very precisely (as we shall see), and we know that all electrons have exactly the same charge\\[1ex]

The elementary charge $e = 1.602176634\times10^{-19}$ C\\[1ex]


\begin{center}
1 C $ = \displaystyle \frac{e}{1.602176634\times10^{-19}} $\\[2ex]
\end{center}

and so 

\begin{center}
1 A $ = \displaystyle \left( \frac{e}{1.602176634\times10^{-19}}\right)  \left( \frac{\Delta \nu_{Cs}}{9.192631770 \times 10^{9}}\right) $\\[2ex]
\end{center}


\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{The other three}
\small

We have used  $\nu_{Cs}$, $c$, $h$, and $e$ to define seconds, metres, kilograms, and Amperes.\\[2ex]

Three more fundamental constants $\rightarrow$ three more SI base units!\\[2ex]

$k_{B} = 1.380649\times10^{-23} $ Joules per Kelvin (base units?)\\[2ex]

$N_{A} = 6.02214076\times10^{23}$ per mole of stuff\\[2ex]

$K_{cd}$ = 683  candela - steradian -per kilogram -per metre squared -seconds cubed\\[2ex]

% \begin{frame}{ Three more useful physical constants}
% 
% We have used 7 fundamental physical constants to define 7 base units. It is useful to use three more constants:\\[1ex]
% 
% The mass of the electron $m_e = 9.109\times10^{-31} kg$ \\[2ex]
% The vacuum permittivity $\epsilon_0 = 8.8541878128(13)\times10^{-12}$ F m$^{-1}$ (Farads* per metre)\\[2ex]
% The reduced planck constant $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$\\[2ex]
% 
% Why? Because with these we can magically make our calculations MUCH simpler.\\[2ex]
% 
% 
% * The Farad is a measure of capacitance, which translates to kg$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$ s$^{4}$ A$^{2}$\\[1ex]
%

\begin{frame}{Natural Units}
\small

When dealing with complex formulae and tiny scales, it makes sense to adjust our system.\\[1ex]

$c = 2.99792458 \times 10^{8}$ ms$^{-1}$\\[1ex]

There exist some units in which I can write $c=1$. It still has the dimensions LT$^{-1}$, but it has the value 1.\\[1ex]

I could similarly do the same thing for other constants that appear regularly in the equations I have to solve.\\[1ex]

 \end{frame}
 
 
 
 
 
 \begin{frame}{ The electronVolt, eV}
 
 The electronVolt is a unit of energy that I use every single day.\\[2ex]
 
% $E = qV$ : the relationship between energy $E$, charge $q$, and potential difference $V$\\[2ex]
%An electron has elementary charge $e=1.6\times 10^{-19}$ C\\[2ex]
%So we can write $E_{e} = eV$ : the energy is an "electronVolt"\\[2ex]
 
 It is small: 1eV $=1.602176634\times10^{-19}$ J \\[2ex]
 
 A Joule is the energy required to accelerate a 1 kg mass at 1 ms$^{-2}$ through a distance of 1 m.\\[2ex]
 
 An electronVolt is the energy gained by an electron accelerated through a potential difference of 1 Volt in a vacuum.\\[2ex]
 
 %Notice: \\
 
 %1 C $ = \frac{e}{1.602176634\times10^{-19}} $\\[2ex]
 
 The eV is a better unit of energy for the kind of physics we are going to be doing.
 
 
 

 \end{frame}
 
 
\begin{frame}{ The electronVolt, eV}
 
1eV $=1.602176634\times10^{-19}$ kg m s$^{-2}$ : Energy in eV \\[2ex]

With this better unit for energy, and the understanding that there exist some units in which I can write $c=1$, we are all set.\\[2ex]

1eV =$1.782662\times10^{-36}$ kg ($\times c^{2}$) : Mass in eV \\[2ex]

1eV =$5.344286\times10^{-28}$ kg m s$^{-1}$ ($\times c$) : Momentum in eV\\[2ex]
 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{ Things in eV}

The mass of the electron:\\[2ex]
$m_e = 9.11\times10^{-31}$ kg $\rightarrow$ 510  keV\\[3ex]

Planck's constant multiplied by the speed of light:\\[2ex]
$hc = 1.99 \times10^{-25}$ Jm $\rightarrow $ 1.24 eV $\mu$m  \\[3ex]

So we get more manageable numbers, in addition to being able to seamlessly relate mass, energy, momentum, ...\\[3ex]

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{ Fully Natural Units}
\small
In particle physics and similar fields, we use the \textbf{natural units}:\\

$c = 1$, $\hbar = 1$, $m_e = 1$, $\epsilon_0 = 1$\\[1ex]

Such that:\\[1ex]

1 s = $1.519 \times 10^{15}\; \hbar\;$ eV\\[1ex]
1 m = $5.068 \times 10^{6}\; c \hbar\;$ eV$^{-1}$\\[1ex]
1 kg = $5.610 \times 10^{35}\; c^{-2}\;$ eV\\[1ex]

Although this seems confusing now, you may gradually learn to love it over the next few years!
