 \subsection{Units, prefixes, and dimensionality}

\begin{frame}{Topic 1.1 : Units, prefixes, and dimensionality}
\small
\textbf{Aim:}\\
To prepare your minds for the strange things to come, by convincing you that things are already strange.\\[3ex]
\textbf{Method:}\\
We will think about how we measure the world around us now, and what led us to use these measurement techniques.\\[1ex]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Where did all this start?}
\small
To do physics, we need clear, agreed-upon definitions and systems of measurements.\\[1ex]
But, human beings started to do science before there was any such clarity...\\[1ex]

\begin{frame}{Length}
Measurements of length or distance tend to have roots in human body parts (and later, farming).\\

\begin{frame}{Time}
Measurements of time tend to have their roots in the things we observe in the sky.\\

\begin{frame}{Weight}
Measurements of weight tend to have their roots in things we can pick up.\\

\begin{frame}{Units}
Thankfully, we now have the Syst\`eme International, with 7 base units: \\[1ex]
%\begin{columns}
%\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Metres, m\\ % The metre is currently defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299 792 458 of a second. 
\item Seconds, s\\
\item Kilograms, kg\\ % lump of metal in parisien basement - > now defined in terms of fundamental constants

\item Amperes, A\\ %The ampere is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be 1.602 176 634 × 10?19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A?s, where the second is defined in terms of ??Cs, the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom
\item Kelvin, K\\ % The kelvin is now defined by fixing the numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to 1.380649×10?23 J?K?1. Hence, one kelvin is equal to a change in the thermodynamic temperature T that results in a change of thermal energy kT by 1.380649×10?23 J.[1] The relation between kelvin and Celsius scales is TK = t°C + 273.15. On the Kelvin scale, pure water freezes at 273.15 K, and it boils at 373.15 K in 1 atm.  Absolute zero does not exist. https://www.sciencealert.com/after-a-century-of-debate-cooling-to-absolute-zero-has-been-declared-mathematically-impossible

\item Candela, cd\\
\item Mole, mol\\

\begin{frame}{Lingering Issues}
\small
For some folks, the metric system has been hard to adopt.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, 1760 yards in a mile. By the way, a mile is 8 furlongs. A fathom is 2 yards and a league is 3 miles. 
\item British pint 568 ml : 20 imperial fluid ounces, \textcolor{red}{ American pint 473 ml : 16 US ounces}
\item British Ton 2,240 pounds (20 hundredweight each of 8 stone each of 14 pounds). \textcolor{red}{American Ton 2,000 pounds}. \textcolor{blue}{Metric tonne 2204.62 pounds}

%\begin{frame}{Amounts of things}
%At some point, human beings took the step of \textbf{quantifying} things. \\[1ex]

%\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Counting Systems}
\small
Like with units, the choice is based on `common sense' rather than anything fundamental:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Sexagesimal [60]
%\item Vigesimal [20]
\item Duodecimal [12] 
\item Decimal [10]
\item Hexadecimal [16]
\item Binary [2]
\end{itemize}

\textit{Are there an infinity of possible counting systems?}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Length: standardising the metre}
\small
First the pendulum was used; then, a fraction of the estimated circumference of the Earth.\\
1791 (-1799): The French National Assembly accepts the proposal that the new definition for the metre be equal to `\textit{one ten-millionth of the length of a quadrant along the Earth's meridian through Paris}'  (the distance from the equator to the north pole.)
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{metre.png}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Time: standardising the second}
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.65\textwidth}
\small
Up to 1400 CE: The earliest mechanical clocks had hours, sometimes divided into quarters, more rarely into 12 parts.\\[1ex]
Clocks with minutes appeared late 16th century, followed by seconds in 17th-18th centuries\\[1ex]
1862: The British Association for the Advancement of Science stated that `\textit{All [people] of science are agreed to use the second of mean solar time as the unit of time.}'
\end{column}

\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weight: standardising the kilogram}
\small
1795: the mass of 1 litre of water (at melting point).\\
There is a prototype kilogram in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sevres, France.

\end{frame}



 
 \begin{frame}{Er, what has this got do with quantum physics? }

The measures and counting systems we use are arbitrary, and have developed organically in a pretty chaotic way.\\[1ex]

There is nothing fundamentally meaningful about a 1 metre distance, or the number 10.\\[1ex]

We can and will abandon standard measures and units in order to make calculations easier.\\[1ex]

There are things in this universe that do seem to be fundamentally meaningful.\\[1ex]

 \begin{frame}{Dimensionality : LMT}
To get a grip and do useful science, we should think about what it is important.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Length [L]\\
\item Mass [M]\\
\item Time [T]\
\end{itemize}

The dimension of area is $L^2$. \\[1ex]
\begin{itemize}
\item[a] What is the dimension of volume?\\[1ex]
\item[b] What is the dimension of density (mass/volume)?\\[1ex]
\item[c] What is the dimension of acceleration?\\[1ex]
\item[d] What is the dimension of force?\\[1ex]
\item[e] What is the dimension of energy?\\[1ex]
\end{itemize}
