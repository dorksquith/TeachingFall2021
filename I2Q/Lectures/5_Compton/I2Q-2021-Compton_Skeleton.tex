\subsection{Diffraction \& x-rays}


%\begin{frame}{Diffraction \& x-rays}

%Shining light on a screen with a hole in it is really strong evidence that light is an EM wave.\\[1ex]
%
%Remember Hertz showed this for radio waves, and then also sparked the photoelectric experiment, which makes radiation look like it is made of particles rather than waves...\\
%
%You will do wave mechanics next term with David Seery, but let's get a little taster now, just enough that we can  for a sensible thought process about what is happening.\\
%
%All waves interfere. If you go to a gig, try slowly moving horizontally between the stage and the sound rig. You will notice a change in both the quality and volume depending on where you are positioned. (Sound waves are not the same as EM waves: they are pressure waves).\\
%
%For EM waves (aka radiation) they leave a source in every direction, spherically.\\
%
%If we mess with that by placing a straight line in its path, we will cause the radiation to interfere with itself\\
%
%At a screen place some distance away, what is happening?\\
%
%When light shines on a surface, we can see it. It reflects off the surface and back to our eyes. What does that mean? Is it the same light?\\
%
%Why does this jumper look blue?\\
%
%Different things can happen when light is incident on a material. \\
%
%The light is scattered from the material\\
%- if it doesn't have enough energy to free an electron this will always happen. It will collide with an electron and conservation of energy means it must be scattered back in some direction.
%- if it does have enough energy to free an electron this can also happen. It will pay the tax, free the electron, and then take the remaining energy off with it.\\
%
%The light is absorbed by the material, having its entire energy redistributed as a tax to free the bound electron, and the freed electron energy.\\
%
%The light is absorbed by the material, but instead of freeing a loosely bound electron, it makes a tightly bound one less loosely bound (excited). This guy will immediately drop back down into its unexcited ground state, and that energy will be released as light of a characteristic frequency.
%
%The light passes through the material, as if it were not there. Or some of it does...
