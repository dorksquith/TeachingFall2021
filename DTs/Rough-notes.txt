Time:
DTs are being given 37 hours each for the 11 week term.
This breaks down as: 10 weeks x (2 hours workshops + 1 hour prep) = 30 hours
Leaving 7 hours for training and marking.
Each student has 10 students to mark in 30 mins per week = 5 hours.
Leaving 2 hours for training.

Technology:
DTs have nont been told how to use the seminar rooms - a practical tutorial in this would be beneficial.
