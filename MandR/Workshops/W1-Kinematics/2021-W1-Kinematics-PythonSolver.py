# Problem 1
print("Problem 1:")
#The position of a particle moving along an x-axis is given by x= 12t^2 − 2t^3, where x is in meters and t is in seconds.  Determine:(a) the position,(b) the velocity, and(c) the acceleration of the particle at t= 4 
# Solution

v = 2*12*pow(t,1) - 6*pow(t,2)

# Problem 2

# A rock is thrown vertically upward from ground level at time t= 0.  At t= 1.5 s it passes the top of a talltower, and 1.0 s later it reaches its maximum height.  What is the height of the tower?
# Solution
# 1. What are we explicitly given in the question?
t_tower = 1.5 
t_max = t_tower + 1 
# 2. What do we know that is not explicitly given in the question?
a = -9.81 # acceleration due to gravity
v_max = 0 # velocity at max height (it must momentarily stop)
# 3. We have v,a,t. We want s (at t=1.5). The initial velocity u is unknown.
# v = u + at, so u = v - at
u = v_max - a*t_max
# 4. Now we have uvat
# s = u*t + 0.5*a*pow(t,2) and we want to use t_tower

# Problem 3

# Two particles move along an x axis. 
# The position of particle 1 is given by x_1 = 6.00*pow(t,2) + 3.00*t + 2.00;
# the acceleration of particle 2 is given by a_2 = −8.00*t and, at t = 0, its velocity is v_2 = 20 m/s.
# When the velocities of the particles match, what is their velocity?
# Solution
# 1. What are we explicitly given in the question?
# x_1 = 6.00*pow(t,2) + 3.00*t + 2.00
# a_2 = −8.00*t
u_2 = 20
# at some time t, v_2(t) = v_1(t)
# 2. What do we know that is not explicitly given in the question?
# we know how to calculate v_1, by differentiating x_1
# v_1 = 12*pow(t,1) + 3.00
# we know how to calculate v_2, as we have u_2 and a_2
# v_2 = u_2 + a_2*t = 20 - 8*pow(t,2)
# we now have v_1 = v_2:
# 12*pow(t,1) + 3.00 = 20 - 8*pow(t,2)
# and we know how to solve a quadratic equation
# 8*pow(t,2) + 12*pow(t,1) - 17 =0

# so finally we plug this value for t back into v_1 (or v_2):

# Problem 4

# A ball is shot vertically upward from the surface of another planet.  A plot of y versus t for the ball is shown inthe figure below, where y is the height of the ball above its starting point and t= 0 at the instant the ball is shot.
# The figure's vertical scaling is set by ys= 30.0m.  What are the magnitudes of :
#(a) the free-fall acceleration on the planet and
#(b) the initial velocity of the ball?
# Solution
# 1. What are we explicitly given in the question/graph?
s_max = 30 # max height
t_max = 2.5 # from the graph
# 2. What do we know that is not explicitly given in the question?

# we are missing u and a, which are what we must find
# s = v*t - 0.5*a*pow(t,2)
